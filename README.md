# Hypothesis Testing on Bluecar usage on different day types

## Research Question
To investigate whether there is a significant difference between Bluecar usage on different day types, i.e weekdays or weekends.

## Claim
The Autolib car sharing company claims that the number of blue cars taken during the weekend is different to the one taken during the weekdays. During this study we will be analyzing, visualizing and manipulating data provided by the Autolib car sharing company concerning the daily usage of bluecars between January and June 2018. We will be mostly interested in the daily summation of blue cars taken from different stations for every day of the week.

We will be using a paired sample t-test for mean since our data is from the same group but from different times of the week.

## Hypothesis
We are going to test the hypothesis that the number of blue cars taken during the weekends is similar to the one taken during the weekdays against the alternative hypothesis that the number of blue cars taken during the weekends varies from the one taken during the weekdays. 
### Key: 
mu₁: mean of bluecars taken during normal weekdays

mu₂: mean of bluecars taken during the weekends

Ho: mu₁ = mu₂.

H1: mu₁ != mu₂
